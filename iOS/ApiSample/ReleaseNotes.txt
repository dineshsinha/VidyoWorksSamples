	Now licencing is working as follows:
	1. Application provides Keychain access
		WHen application uses VidyoClient lib and signed with XX.entitlements (CODE_SIGN_ENTITLEMENTS = XX.entitlements) which has in keychain-access-groups exact item 
		"$(AppIdentifierPrefix)VidyoLicense" - consume additional license only after applying "Reset All Content and Settings" and fresh installation
	2. Application doesn't provide Keychain access
		Application that have not been signed with XX.entitlements or does not have required item "$(AppIdentifierPrefix)VidyoLicense"
		has licensing mechanism based on [UIDevice identifierForVendor] with following iOS limitations - 
		a) consume additional license after complete deleting and installing fresh Application
		b) consume additional license on every Application's launch in case of [UIDevice identifierForVendor] returns all "0000" - known bug at least in iOS 6 for applications obtained "via air"
